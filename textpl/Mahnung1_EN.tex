Earlier this summer we have sent you the member invoice for the Pirates Without Borders membership. That probably escaped your attention, because as of today no payment arrived at our account.

On behalf of the newly elected board of Pirates Without Borders I wish you a happy new year – although with slight delay. We'd like to apologise for the delayed billing. As regular work has been taken up again only since the regular General Assembly on March 15th, this mail is delivered to you so late.

\textbf{We would like to ask you to transfer the outstanding amount of %Amount% within 30 days.}

Please pay using the following Infomation: \newline
Amount: %Amount% \newline
Purpose of Transfer: \textbf{PWBREF=M-2014-%ID%} \newline
IBAN: CH83 0900 0000 9164 3699 8 \newline
Bank: Postfinance Bern, Switzerland \newline
BIC: POFICHBEXXX \newline
Account Number: 91-643699-8 \hfill (only few banks will still require this from you)

We recommend to go for a SEPA transaction, if you have that opportunity.

Based on feedback we would like to offer  alternative payment methods in the future. I am currently implementing a payment process through Bitpay and we are open to other suggestions. If you are interested, just write me an answer to pat.maechler@pirates-without-borders.org
