As treasurer of the Pirates without Borders, I am pleased to welcome you as a new member in our association!

Since you only receive your rights as a member solely upon payment of your membership fee, I would like to ask you \textbf{to transfer the amount of %Amount% as soon as possible}.

Please pay using the following Infomation: \newline
Amount: %Amount% \newline
Purpose of Transfer: $PWBREF=M-2014-%ID%$ \newline
IBAN: CH83 0900 0000 9164 3699 8 \newline
Bank: Postfinance Bern, Switzerland \newline
BIC: POFICHBEXXX \newline
Account Number: 91-643699-8 \hfill (only few banks will still require this from you)

We recommend to go for a SEPA transaction, if you have that opportunity.

Based on feedback we would like to offer  alternative payment methods in the future. I am currently implementing a payment process through Bitpay and we are open to other suggestions. If you are interested, just write me an answer to pat.maechler@piraten-without-grenzen.org
